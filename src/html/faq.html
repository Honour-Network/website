        </p>
        <p class="t-item-staff-introduce">
          FundTech platform is not a fundraising or tokenization of assets platform which many projects offer. We
          different from others in the following ways: <br>1. We created the entire life-cycle of asset management on
          the blockchain to enable efficiency, lower cost &amp; transparency. <br>2. We enable the open verification
          &amp; audit of transactions, documents &amp; authorisations made on the assets. <br>3. FundTech platform is a
          decentralised application. <br>4. We enable collaboration between the asset managers, amongst the blockchain
          community on investment &amp; divestment decision. <br>5. We adhere regulatory standards required by the
          asset-backed token issuers.
