            Who Are We?

          <p class="t-item-staff-introduce">
            We are a blockchain protocol & platform to tokenise real world assets, issue asset-backed tokens and connecting global investors. Our community users earn our native tokens to maintain decentralised governance and incentive. We have committed customers & partnerships that believe in us. Our team has both background in technology and asset management.
            <br><br>
            We are making it cheaper to buy & own fractionalised assets with its asset-backed tokens on the blockchain. Buyers can buy with cryptocurrency or fiat currency and there are no intermediaries. Everything is borderless & seamless.
            <br><br>
            To achieve this, we build FundTech platform using an open source blockchain protocol developed by us (Honour Protocol), paired with its native tokens (Honour Network Access “HNA”) to power the ecosystem. HonourDAO designs the governance & incentive model.
            <br><br>
            We have 4 mandates in our business model to drive more values for HNA token holders.
            <br>
            1.  HonourPremier connects issuers to a ready pool of global investors.
            <br>
            2.  HonourDeals uncovers quality assets & investments to investors.
            <br>
            3.  HonourConnect enables more ways for asset-backed tokens to transfer or trade.
            <br>
            4.  HonourGlobal enables anyone anywhere to access our services.
