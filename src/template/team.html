            are in the midst of an evolution
            where opportunities will be abundance. The entire economy and infrastructure will have major movements
            with trusted third parties being made almost redundant. Legality, taxation and accountancy have to be
            adjusted for this evolution. Smart contract will lead to secure, faster and cheaper management of
            contractual
            relationships where all parties involved receives their fair share when conditions are met. These automatons
            may remove some jobs but will surely create a new set of working conditions and job scope. People will
            work in partnership and will have the ability to choose projects that we like to be involved in.
